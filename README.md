## Description

An arcade-style platform shooter where the player's health is constantly decreasing. The player's health is constantly bleeding away so they must rush to collect blood bags (that will appear at random spawn points throughout the level) to increase their health. Enemies will also randomly appear at these spawn points and attempt to prevent the player from surviving. The levels will be procedurally generated to make each play through feel fresh yet familiar.
